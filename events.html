                The ninth annual Multi-Stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for the Sustainable Development Goals (STI Forum) will be held from Thursday, 9 May, to Friday, 10 May 2024. The Forum will be convened by the President of ECOSOC, Her Excellency Paula Narváez, who had appointed two co-chairs – Her Excellency Christina Markus Lassen, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Denmark to the United Nations, and Her Excellency Inga Rhonda King, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to the United Nations. As per its mandate, the Forum will be prepared by the UN interagency task team on STI for the SDGs (IATT), convened by UN DESA and UNCTAD, and the 10-Member Group of High-Level Representatives appointed by the Secretary-General.

                As in previous years, the theme of the STI Forum will be closely aligned with that of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), to be held from Monday, 8 July, to Wednesday, 17 July 2024, under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council, but will have an exclusive focus on the role and contributions of science, technology and innovation to sustainable development. The 2024 HLPF will hold in-depth reviews of five SDGs: Goal 1 - End poverty in all its forms everywhere; Goal 2 -  End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture; Goal 13 - Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts; Goal 16 - Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels; and Goal 17 - Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development.

                Accordingly, the theme for the STI Forum 2024 is: “Science, technology and innovation for reinforcing the 2030 Agenda and eradicating poverty in times of multiple crises: the effective delivery of sustainable, resilient and innovative solutions”.

                The 2024 Partnership Forum of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) was held on 30 January 2024 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York under the theme of “Reinforcing the 2030 Agenda and eradicating poverty in times of multiple crises: the effective delivery of sustainable, resilient and innovative solutions”. The Forum placed a special emphasis on the Sustainable Development Goals that will be reviewed at the 2024 HLPF, namely Goal 1 (no poverty); Goal 2 (zero hunger); Goal 13 (climate action); Goal 16 (peace and justice); and Goal 17 (partnership for the Goals). 
 
                In accordance with resolution 75/290A, the 2024 ECOSOC Partnership Forum was focused on the exchange of new ideas, expectations and priorities for the work ahead for ECOSOC and the HLPF on the aforementioned theme. It will showcase and discuss forward-looking actions by countries and all relevant stakeholders through innovative partnerships that could mobilize commitments and actions to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and address new challenges.

                The theme for the 2024 High-Level Political Forum, scheduled from Monday, 8 July, to Wednesday, 17 July 2024, underscores the imperative to “Reinforce the 2030 Agenda and eradicate poverty in times of multiple crises: the effective delivery of sustainable, resilient, and innovative solutions.” The HLPF will conduct an in-depth review of pivotal SDGs, including:

                SDG 1 (End poverty)
                SDG 2 (End hunger)
                SDG 13 (Climate action)
                SDG 16 (Peaceful and inclusive societies), and
                SDG 17 (Means of implementation and Global Partnership for Sustainable Development)
                Notably, the 2024 HLPF, following the 2023 SDG Summit, presents a unique opportunity to translate political commitments into tangible policy guidance and practical actions, steering the course for SDG implementation.

                To support the HLPF review of SDG13, the Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG) of UN DESA, in collaboration with the UNFCCC secretariat and other relevant partners, organised an Expert Group Meeting (EGM) on SDG 13, to advance the global action on climate change in synergy with the 2030 Agenda objectives on sustainable development.

 

                Objectives
                As we crossed the midpoint of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the first Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement, home to the implementation of SDG 13 on climate action, the urgency is clear to bridge the development and climate ambition gaps swiftly, while ensuring protection of nature and just and equitable transition pathways.

                The EGM aimed to:<br>

                Identify challenges and opportunities for accelerating transformations.
                Strengthen interlinkages between SDG13 with other SDGs and opportunities to leverage synergies and minimize trade-offs.
                Share knowledge about success stories, good practices and lessons learned.
                Suggest ways forward in terms of policies and regulatory frameworks, finance, innovation and technology, partnerships and coordinated actions at all levels.
                Take stock of recent commitments on SDG 13, including through intergovernmental processes such the UNFCCC COPs, UNGA Summits, annual HLPFs, UN Biodiversity Conferences, and others.
                The meeting gathered over 60 global experts, delineating strategic and actionable recommendations to assess progress on SDG 13 while ensuring co-benefits and synergies with other interlinked SDGs, thus shaping the global response to climate change and advancing sustainable, resilient solutions. 

                The experts represented UN system, governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society from all regions of the world, joining the EGM in person in Tokyo and virtually. The summary of EGM discussions will be prepared by the convening organisations, providing substantial contributions to the thematic reviews scheduled for the 2024 HLPF and shaping its outcomes. The discussions held during the EGM are integral to fostering a comprehensive and impactful approach to addressing the challenges and opportunities associated with SDG 13.

                 The EGM on SDG13 was convened by UN DESA and UNFCCC secretariat, co-organised with UN University. The meeting was hosted by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan with the support of the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES).</p>

                The theme of the 2024 High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) is “Reinforcing the 2030 Agenda and eradicating poverty in times of multiple crises: the effective delivery of sustainable, resilient and innovative solutions”.

                The HLPF in July 2024 will be the first HLPF under the auspices of ECOSOC after the 2023 SDG Summit - the HLPF convened under the auspices of the General Assembly in September 2023. The 2024 HLPF will support the implementation of the Political Declaration and other outcomes of the SDG Summit for advancing the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs.  The Forum will provide an opportunity to translate the political guidance and commitments from the SDG Summit into tangible policy guidance and practical actions. 

                In this context, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), are co-organizing an Expert Group Meeting (EGM) to prepare the 2024 HLPF review of SDG 2 – and its role in advancing sustainable development across the 2030 Agenda, with the support of interested UN system organizations.
